# Stock Pitch Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project was created to analyze the excess return performance of stocks compared to the S&P 500 index. The data comes from a series of stock pitches I made while being part of the investments team at Providence. Each week, I presented a stock pitch to the team and kept track of the performance of these stocks.

## Data and Methods

- **Stock Price Data**: This includes the historical stock prices of the companies I pitched from Yahoo Finance.
- **S&P 500 Data**: Used as a benchmark to measure excess returns.
- **Excess Return Calculation**: Each stock's return is compared to the S&P 500â€™s return over the same period to determine whether the stock outperformed or underperformed the market.
